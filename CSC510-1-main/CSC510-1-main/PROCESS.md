# Sprint Reflections

## Sprint 1

Cristina:  
I think the scrum meetings helped a lot knowing what everyone was doing and how our team was regarding the completeness of what was required on sprint 1.

Jack:  
I think our process went well. Adding in everything to issues and then putting in everything to the Kanban board helped with keeping track of what needed and what was done for this iteration. Doing the skrum meetings daily helped a bit with discussing what was getting done and what was going on, but doing it daily was a bit annoying an unnecessary in my opinion. We could've checked in every other day and I think we could've been fine, but if we ran into more trouble during this iteration, meeting up and connecting each day would probably help connecting all of us to see if others needed help.

Anna:  
The process for sprint 1 was very efficient for me. We planned tasks together and were able to plan better on what else needed to be completed or what blockers were causing challenges. The scrum meetings kept us accountable and moving at a steady pace. While the meeting notes became a useful tool to reflect on. The Kanban project board allowed us to see visually the progress we were making. It was also a lot easier to look at the relationship between our work and how it all connected.

Trevor:  
I think we had a decent process. Starting with a new team, sprint planning was difficult since we had conflicting schedules, but we were able to use when2meet to find a few minutes each day. We had individuals putting in work every day, and we actively had reviews comments being made and addressed throughout the sprint. We did not have procrastination and put in consistent work across the sprint. Stories statuses in the project board were mostly maintained accurately. Scrums were timely, and we ensured everyone's updates were heard before diving into deeper sidecar discussions for a follow up team meeting.

## Sprint 2

Cristina:  
I think the process for sprint2 went well. We had our scrum meetings everyday, which were very useful.  Also, having the Kanban project board was very helpful, since we could  actually "see" how the tasks were being completed. I also think in this sprint the workload even out and everyone ended up with kind of the same workload for the entire project so far. 

Anna:  
This sprint I felt that the project board was great for seeing the issues that everyone assigned to themselves and how the work load was split. By doing daily scrum, I was able to see other's progress and make sure that my work was aligning with what other's needed to get done and changes I should review. I felt it was very helpful and more efficient this week than last - as everyone had the hang of the meetings and collaborated well. Overall it was a great sprint.

Jack:  
Like I've said, I still think the everyday scrum is a bit too much and everything would be fine if we just met every other day for it. With the way things went this time, most things getting done quickly and ahead of time. Chat composers was completed and tested by everyone who worked on it, but we probably could've communicated better when merging because we ended up with a few merging issues after all the merges to chat composer. Have one person assigned to test chat composer ended up being unnecessary because everyone who worked on it also tested it. Overall though, I think the project this sprint went smoothly. Using the project board wasn't super helpful because we already had things listed out in issues, but I guess it was fine for seeing the progress of things.

Trevor:  
This sprint seems very relaxed for me. We had good teamwork and pull request processing. There were some issues surrounding merge conflicts since the last items to work on were mostly in the chat composer. We collaborated to work out how to integrate our changes together though, and successfully reflected everyone's work in the final product. I would say our project is now feature complete. We did make two amendments to our original design to improve usability and to close a loophole users could have used to cheat. We will need to ask the teaching staff how best to document those design changes. Scrums seemed more streamlined as well now that we had practice.
