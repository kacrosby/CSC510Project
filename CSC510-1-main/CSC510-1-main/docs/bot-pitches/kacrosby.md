Name: Repo Rewards - 
This bot is designed to notify and incentivize tasks completed by developer groups. The team can make a list of tasks that need to be completed in their projects section of their repo. As teammates add items to their “in progress”,  Repo Rewards will send the team an update such as “User one has taken on the challenge - Update ReadMe File!”. This allows other team members to see what tasks are being worked on in a fun and encouraging way - and also drive competition using a points system. Emoji’s can be assigned for certain points such as: taking on a task can earn you a rocket, completing a task can earn you a gold star, and adding to the To Do list can give you a fire symbol. All of these can add visual aids and cues to the other members as to what is being worked on and completed.

Repo Rewards could also update a file within the repo to keep track of points for each user - updating every time a task is changed. This allows developers to see who is managing the most tasks and how the workload is being split.
