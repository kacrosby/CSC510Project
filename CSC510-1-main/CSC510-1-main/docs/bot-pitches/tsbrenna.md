While intended for classwork, Piazza provides an interface that could also be leveraged effectively to track questions between a group of users and a development team. The development team would play the part of the instructors while the users would be the students. Since there is never a shortage of work for developers, incentivising users to help one another can improve productivity. While individual questions do track things like "thanks" on questions and answers, this is less visible and does not represent the aggregate of a user's contributions.

To address this, we would like to create a reward system similar to the Karma system in the stackoverflow/stackexhange family of applications. The bot could use the Piazza apis to track when users respond to question before developers, and also reward users who provide answer or question that the developers approve of. Similarly, we could offer greater reward for greater impact by providing more reward points per "thanks!" Making the assumption that each such interaction is another developer intervention avoided. The bot could post announcements/notes on a regular basis indicating the rolling average most helpful users, along with the all time most helpful users, so that their piers can recognize them for their contributions.
