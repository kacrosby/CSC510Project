When many people are working on a team project in github, there may be times where people just want to merge to main without considering other teammates. However, in a good process, code in a pull request would ideally be reviewed by everyone else before it is mergerd to main. This bot would incentivize this by reward people for reviewing, commenting, approving, or finding problems in the code for someone's pull request. It would also punish people who don't want to follow the process and if they try to or do (depending on the implementation) merge immediately, they will get punished and lose points and/or privileges.
